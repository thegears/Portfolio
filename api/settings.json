Then I went to high school, and I had a computer class in high school. While there, I met python. As I go a little further, I finally get the node.js with discord.js.I met him thanks to js. The first months I wrote code by studying the code, doing trial and error. And then I started to improve. And I'm still improving myself. Technologies I use: discord.js, express, wio.db, mongodb, react, next, vue, nuxt, etc.",
